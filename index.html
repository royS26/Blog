            Death Valley, Los Angeles, Caifornia, USA

<p>
    Death Valley is one of the most iconic yet understated national parks in the US! The park is so diverse that even though I had camped at the National Park fro aound four to five days, I kept finding new activities to do. This wonderful national park is located in the Mojave Desert of California, Death Valley is famous for its rugged landscapes, extreme temperatures, and unique natural sights.

    It’s known to be one of the most humid and driest places on earth and for many, Death Valley has definitely lived up to its name… but don’t get discouraged too soon! There is so much beauty within the park and it should irrefutably be on your bucket list. In this blog I'll be covering everything you need to plan your own getaway.

    <p>
        Given the fact that Death Valley is a whopping 5,270 mi², there are a lot of areas to explore and numerous things to consider when planning your trip. I wouldn’t say it’s the kind of park you want to just show and wing it. The reason being is that phone service is very limited within Death Valley and WiFi isn’t easy to come by. It’s best to know at least the basics of where you are going and where you plan to stay the night BEFORE you arrive at the park. Before we jump into it, I would like to acknowledge the traditional landowners of this area, the Timbisha Shoshone People. Please be respectful of their land and consider your impact when visiting. I implore you to always follow Leave No Trace Principles and follow all local rules.

    <h1>HOW TO GET TO DEATH VALLEY</h1>
<p>Death Valley is located in the United States in a remote part of south-eastern California. The park also slightly stretches into western Nevada. Death Valley National Park can be accessed by the following means:</p>

<h3>BY CAR</h3>
<p>Car is the most common way visitors access Death Valley National Park. Most people will drive from Los Angeles and enter the park through the west entrance (4.5-hour drive to Furnace Creek), or from Las Vegas and enter the park through the east entrance (2.5-hour drive to Furnace Creek). A unique way to travel to and around Death Valley National Park is by renting a camper van. I wanted to do a van trip with my family which would have been really enjoyable .</p>

<h3>BY PLANE</h3>
<p>The closest commercial airport to Death Valley National Park is McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas (130 miles away). The second closest major airport is Los Angeles International Airport (270 miles away). There are also a few smaller airport options, including Inyokern County Airport (70 miles away), Furnace Creek Airport (inside the park), and Stovepipe Wells Airport (inside the park). I believe the two airports inside the park are options for private planes only. If flying into one of these airports, you would need to rent a car and drive to the park, or take a guided tour that includes transportation.</p>

<p>"Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,” he said wisely one day, “but people don’t know what it is like or how to make it. Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen until you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.”
